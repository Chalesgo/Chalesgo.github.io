How you accomplished each item in the criteria except for README file discussion: I did so by following and modifying the youtube tutorial instructions and adding stuff I wanted. 

Insights that you have gathered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1): Directly coding any website will be long especially the css and integrating animations is hard 

Struggles that you have encountered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1): One prominent one is two containers blocking and interferring with each other, the code in css sometimes are not working with me as it seems to want to do its own thing, adding animations with my website was hard so i scrapped it and kept only basic ones.

How you could improve your website in the future: Adding more animation and website design will surely improve it.
